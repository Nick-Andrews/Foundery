# Foundery


**A Wordpress Plugin to manage boardroom and reserved space bookings for co-working. 

This was initially created for The Foundery Toronto.

 Users of this system need to have a login/password on your website. 

The Wordpress User status of these users is up to you. You add users from the Wordpress admin panel Users -> Add New.  *I recommend setting users to the lowest access level: Subscriber.* Wordpress lets you choose Subscriber, Contributor, Author, Editor, Administrator as different user status types.


**Upload the Plugin


In order to try out this plugin on your Wordpress website, download the .zip folder  and then upload it to your website using Plugins -> Add New -> Upload plugin  from the Wordpress admin panel.



**Setting up the Plugin
The plugin, when activated, will present a menu link in your admin panel showing a small red fire icon. 

The first submenu link is *THE FOUNDERY*. This page lets you adjust the time parameters for your system and set up the data on spaces that are available to your co-working members.


*STEP 1*: 
Open and Close times
-What time, in a 24 hour clock cycle, is the space open for business?

Hourly segmentations
-Set to 15 minute or 30 minute segments

Status categories for your members: 
Hotdesk
Dedicated
Part time
Office
Guest
Staff
Event
- Set the number of hours per day these members status levels can book.

*
STEP 2*:
Enter data to describe the different boardroom, event and shared spaces that are available for reservation to your co-work space members.


**Setting up Users

The Second menu link is *FOUNDERY PERMS*. This page lets you assign members on your Wordpress website to a status level based upon their membership in your co-work space. The 8 status levels I have created are based upon what The Foundery in Toronto used. I can change these and customise them to your needs if you require that. The "banned" category is for people who have been expelled; I hope you do not need to use it. The other seven categories are self-explanatory. You can re-purpose them as you like by adjusting the number of hours they are allotted in the first menu link. 

**Managing the Logs



The third menu link *FOUNDERY LOGS* shows what has been booked in the system. You can truncate this log and that will remove a booking from the system for any member.


 I need to develop more features on this page and will update these files when I get to it.
